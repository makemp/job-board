Last Updated: 04 July 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and handle your personal information when you use our job board for drilling and mining professionals. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.

1. Information We Collect
We collect information to provide and improve our services. The type of information we collect depends on how you use our platform.

a) Information for Employers/Recruiters:

When you register an account or post a job, we collect the following information:

Company Name: To identify the organisation posting the job.

Contact Email: For communication regarding your account and job postings.

CV/Application Email: The email address where you wish to receive candidate applications.

Billing and Tax Details: This information is collected to process payments and for invoicing. Please note that payment processing is handled by our third-party provider, Stripe, and we receive billing and tax details from them after a successful transaction.

b) Information Collected Automatically:

When you visit our website, we automatically collect certain information to help us with analytics and troubleshooting. This includes:

Your IP address.

Your web browser type and version.

The pages you visit on our site.

c) Information from Job Seekers:

Currently, we do not require job seekers to create an account or provide personal information directly to us to browse or apply for jobs. When a job seeker clicks "Apply" or to send a CV, they will do so directly to the email address provided by the employer.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To Provide Our Services: To allow employers to post job listings and manage them through their dashboard.

To Process Payments: We use your contact and billing information to process payments for our services through Stripe.

For Communication: To send you important notifications, such as alerts that your job posting is about to expire, or to respond to your queries.

For Internal Analytics and Troubleshooting: To understand how our service is being used, to identify issues, and to make improvements to our website and offerings.

3. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We only share your data with third parties in the following circumstances:

Stripe: To process payments, we share your contact email and any data you provide directly within the Stripe checkout form. We encourage you to review Stripe's Privacy Policy to understand their data practices.

Job Seekers: Your company name and the designated email address for receiving applications will be visible to job seekers who view your job posting.

4. Data Storage and Security
Your data is stored on secure servers which may be located in the United Kingdom or the United States. While we are working on implementing encryption, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We are committed to improving our security measures to protect your data.

5. Your Data Rights and Choices
We believe in giving you control over your information.

Access and Update: You can access and update your company and billing information at any time through your user dashboard.

Account Deletion: You have the right to close your account at any time via your dashboard. Upon closing your account, we will take steps to either permanently delete your personal data or obscure it (for example, by removing your email address from a record but retaining the non-personal record for statistical purposes).

6. Data Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active. If your account is inactive for a period of one year, we may delete your data. You can also request the deletion of your data at any time by closing your account.

7. Cookies and Tracking
We use cookies and our own internal tracking for essential website functionality and analytics.

Cookies: We use cookies primarily to keep you logged into your account securely.

Internal Tracking: We track on-site activity, such as the pages you visit and when "Apply" buttons are clicked. This is for internal analytics to help us understand how our service is used and to improve the user experience. We do not use third-party tracking services like Google Analytics.
